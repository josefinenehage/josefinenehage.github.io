    <p> Hi! üëãüèº My name is Josefin Enehage. I‚Äôm an Information Systems MSc student with a passion for digitalization,
        business information systems and programming. </p>
    <p>I have previously worked as an application consultant in the ERP system Infor M3. A job which put high demands on
        understanding the business flow and demanded a great deal of problem solving and being adaptive. As well as more
        technical aspects such as database and SQL knowledge. </p>
    <p> In my free time I can often be found at programming workshops such as Pink Programming. I usually work on small
        front-end projects just for fun in javascript. But my experience from school is mainly Java.</p>
    <p> Besides programming, I like to stay fit and active and enjoy going to the gym. I also enjoy being being social
        and meeting new people.</p>
